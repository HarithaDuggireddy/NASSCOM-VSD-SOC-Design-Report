Getting Knowledge on opensource EDA Tools, OpenLANE, SKY130nm PDk, QFN48 Package, chip, pads, core, die, IP's, RISC-V and Softaware to HArdware Applications.

Let's Take an AURDUINO LEONARD Board. In that we have one processor chip. we have many interfaces around the processor they are JTAG-UART FTDI, QSPI1-FLASH, I2C0-EEPROM, VCC/GND, ADc(QSP3), MUXED with GPIOS, SDRAM chip, DIrect I2C, direct QSPI, GPIO0-7, PWM0-3, GPIO8-14, PWM4-5
